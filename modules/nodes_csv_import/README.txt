Usage Instructions:
------------------------------------
Please upload 'UTF-8' file types
The dropdown lists all the content types in your current site. The table below the dropdown shows automatically all the fields added for that content type.
Once you select the content type, along with all the fields, 'nid ' is also listed.
If 'nid ' column is updated in the CSV file column, then the node content with that specific nid will be updated. If the nid column is empty in the CSV file, then a new node will be created of the same content type.
